# C++ Coding Standard - Math Library
Simple, general, unoriginal math library presenting the code style/standards used in ongoing C++ projects.

Project aims to be the "codebase as a coding conventions reference", because:
* Raw lists of points stating the rules are hard to read and maintain.
* Generalized, abstract projects are not reflecting everyday coding situations.
